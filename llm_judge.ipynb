This means your heart was not filling with blood properly, which was causing problems for a while and got worse recently. What happened in the hospital? The doctors did many tests. They found that you had too much fluid in your body and low red blood cells. They gave you a medicine called Lasix to help your body get rid of extra fluid. They also found a stone in your salivary gland, which is a small organ in your mouth that makes saliva. You had a special test called a video capsule endoscopy. This test found some bleeding and small blood vessels in your small intestine. What should I know after leaving the hospital? You will go to a skilled nursing facility for more care.

After a subsequent visit on March 16, she was admitted for pain management and physical therapy, showing improvement before being discharged. However, an MRI ordered by her primary care physician on May 18 indicated significant concerns, revealing marked marrow replacement and edema in the vertebral bodies L1-L5, along with findings suggestive of multifocal discitis or osteomyelitis, and potential abscess formation contributing to severe thecal sac narrowing.    \n",

You were hospitalized because of osteomyelitis and discitis of the lumbar region. Osteomyelitis means an infection in your bone. Discitis means an infection in the discs in your spine. These infections needed strong medicine given through a needle in your vein. What happened in the hospital? The doctors did a special scan called an MRI. They found signs of infection in your spine. They also found a phlegmon, which is a pocket of infection. You did not need surgery. The doctors gave you strong medicine through a needle in your vein to fight the infection. You also had a small procedure to put a PICC line. A PICC line is a long, thin tube that goes into your vein. It helps give medicine. What should I know after leaving the hospital? You will continue the strong medicine at home through the PICC line for 6 weeks. You will need to see an infection doctor closely.\"\n",
