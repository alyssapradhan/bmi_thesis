Patient states he has a hx of GIB - was hospitalized last year - and had an EGD at that time which was notable for erosive gastritis, erosive duodenitis and duodenal ulcer. He follows with Dr. Rizzo (GI) and was planned for EGD 07/09 to monitor these findings. Per chart review the EGD was notable for non-bleeding gastric ulcer with pigmented material - which was biopsied. There was also findings of gastritis. Patient stated he went home and had a hot and sour soup and thereafter had 2 episodes of dark bowel movements and one episode of vomiting bright red blood. \\n\\nPatient then called his gastroenterologist and was told to come into the ED. \\n\\n \\n\\nED Course\\n\\nWhile in the ED the patient's course is notable for large volume hematemesis and hypotension 90/50's. Labs were notable for Hg at lactate of 5.3, BUN of 56, Hg of 11.4 (with previous baseline 03/2024 in 14.5) s/p 1U. GI evaluated the patient - s/p urgent EGD with findings of clotted blood seen in the stomach, bright red blood seen in the duodenal bulb, and 5mm cratered ulcer at the pre-pyloric area s/p 2 clips.\\n\\n \\n\\nAt time of exam patient denied recent fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain. Patient stated he was having melena and hematemesis after the endoscopy and a large volume of hematemesis in the ED with associated nausea. He denied any current nausea at the time of evaluation. He also states that at home prior to these episodes today - he was not having melena or hematemesis - he states he's been in his normal state of health. Last use of ASA was a few days ago. \\n\\n \\n\\nHoag 1\\n\\n7/11 Cleared by GI to resume ASA, unheld cardiovascular meds. Hemoglobin remains stable. Diet was advanced. \\n\\n7/12 Due to having one episode of bright red blood per rectum and experiencing dizziness, cardiovascular meds were reheld. Hemoglobin is slowly declining but still above transfusion threshold. PM CBC stable. Was orthostatics positive, pending repeat. \\n\\n7/13 hemoglobin has stabilized, low suspicion for active bleeding at this time.
